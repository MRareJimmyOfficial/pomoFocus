## Why pomoFocus?

Created with ❤️ by [Mrarejimmy](https://github.com/MRareJimmyOfficial), this isn't your grandma's kitchen timer! We've added:

- **Sleek Design**: Rounded corners smoother than a fresh jar of tomato sauce.
- **Task Tracking**: Because remembering 10,000 todos is _so_ last season.
- **Stealth Mode**: Hide in system tray when the boss walks by.
- **One-Click Control**: Start/stop smoother than Mario slides down a flagpole.

## Quick Start

1. **Install:**

git clone https://github.com/MRareJimmyOfficial/pomoFocus.git
cd pomoFocus
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Run:**

python pomodoro_timer.py
