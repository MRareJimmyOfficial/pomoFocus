## Why pomoFocus?

Created with ❤️ by [Mrarejimmy](https://github.com/MRareJimmyOfficial), this isn't your grandma's kitchen timer! We've added:

- **Sleek Design**: Rounded corners smoother than a fresh jar of tomato sauce.
- **Task Tracking**: Because remembering 10,000 todos is _so_ last season.
- **Stealth Mode**: Hide in system tray when the boss walks by.
- **One-Click Control**: Start/stop smoother than Mario slides down a flagpole.

**Note for future enhancement**: Consider adding screenshots of the app interface when ready. Images of productivity tools like timers, task management UIs, or Pomodoro-themed visuals would enhance this README.
