## 🌟 Why pomoFocus?

Created with ❤️ by [Mrarejimmy](https://github.com/MRareJimmyOfficial), this isn't your grandma's kitchen timer! We've added:

- 🎨 **Sleek Design**: Rounded corners smoother than a fresh jar of tomato sauce
- 📊 **Task Tracking**: Because remembering 10,000 todos is _so_ last season
- 🕶️ **Stealth Mode**: Hide in system tray when the boss walks by
- 🎮 **One-Click Control**: Start/stop smoother than Mario slides down a flagpole

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** (brew some coffee while you wait ☕):
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

2. **Run** (channel your inner productivity ninja 🥷):
